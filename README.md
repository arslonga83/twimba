# Twimba project from Scrimba FrontEnd Developer Course

https://arslonga83.github.io/twimba/

This is my finished Twimba project. I completed several stretch goals:
- added ability to reply to posts
- added delete button to each post
- all data saved in local storage
- added a 'reset' button to restore data (this was helpful during testing as I kept replying/deleting/etc...)
